The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it's a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so they aren't typing the same things over and over again.

As well, researchers often find themselves confronted with large amounts of data to process or large simulations to run.  These sorts of problems can take more time and computer hardware than is readily available on personal computers.  Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including "high-performance computing" supercomputers).

These lessons will start you on a path towards using the Linux shell and remote Linux servers effectively.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the
> shell.  If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize
> the word “file” and either “directory” or “folder” (two common words
> for the same thing), you're ready for this lesson.
>
> If you're already comfortable manipulating files and directories,
> searching for files with `grep` and `find`, and writing simple loops
> and scripts, you probably won't learn much from this lesson.
