## Getting lesson materials

You need to download some files to follow this lesson:

1. Download [shell-novice-data.zip]({{ page.root }}/data/shell-novice-data.zip) and move the file to your Desktop.
2. Unzip/extract shell-novice-data.zip (ask your instructor if you need help with this step). You should end up with a new folder called data-shell on your Desktop.
3. Download [remote-data.zip]({{ page.root }}/data/remote-data.zip), but do not unzip it.  Using Safari on a Mac, hold down Option while clicking this download to avoid unzipping it.

## Connecting to Carleton's VPN

To be able to connect to the RCDC from your laptop (using wifi) or from outside of campus, you will need to connect to Carleton's VPN. Full instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://carleton.ca/its/help-centre/remote-access/). 

## Installing Linux terminal software

### Windows 10 Users

To be able to participate in this lesson we will need you to install some software to give you access to a command shell. MobaXTerm is a powerful terminal program for Windows. It allows you to use Linux commands on a Windows PC. The free Home Edition of MobaXterm can be found [here](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html).

Once you have installed MobaXTerm, run the program. Then click the *Start local terminal* button in the middle of the MobaXterm window.

MobaXterm users will also need to install the nano program.  To do this from your MobaXterm local terminal, type `mobapt install nano` followed by the Enter key.

Once you have gotten to this point you are ready to participate in the lesson.

### Mac Users

To open a terminal window on a Mac, navigate to Applications/Utilities and open Terminal. Once you have reached this stage you are ready to participate in the lesson.
